# azh412's Pneumonia detection with Artificial Intelligence (Convolutional Neural Network)

This is PneumoniaDiagnose, an artificially intelligent Neural Network that can detect pneumonia by the means of chest x-rays.

**WARNING:** THIS IS NOT FINISHED, CURRENT ACCURACY IS â‰ˆ 75%

For the best accuracy and performance, use the releases. (On the right)

## Training

1. `cd` to the folder named pneumoniadiagnose/
2. Execute the following command to train the neural network. 

    **NOTE:** If you have multiple versions of Python, you must replace the word `python` with `python3`

        python pneumonia.py trainpneumonia.py train test pneumoniamodel.h5
        
    Be sure to say `yes` when asked to save the trained model.
Now you can start using the Neural Network!

## Usage
Execute the following command, and make sure you replace the word IMAGE with your image name in your filesystem. 

   **NOTE:** If you have multiple versions of Python, you must replace the word `python` with `python3`

        python pneumonia.py pneumoniamodel.h5 IMAGE
